Gen2X Security Engineering Platform

Module:
    response_enums.py

===============================================================================

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module defines the enumerations used by the Gen2X Response Framework.

A Response represents the actions recommended after analysis has been
completed.

Unlike threat analysis, response planning is concerned with:

    • What action should occur?
    • Who owns that action?
    • Does the action require approval?
    • How urgent is the action?
    • How will the action be performed?
    • What happened after execution?

The response framework intentionally separates planning from execution.

This allows Gen2X to support:

    • AWS
    • Azure
    • Google Cloud Platform
    • Kubernetes
    • VMware
    • On-premises environments

without changing the framework itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Architectural Philosophy

Indicators answer:

    "What did we observe?"

Providers answer:

    "What evidence exists?"

Threat Analysis answers:

    "What does the evidence mean?"

Reporting answers:

    "How do we communicate it?"

Response answers:

    "What should happen next?"

Execution engines decide HOW those actions occur.

Chewbacca's Commentary 🐾

Many new engineers believe automation means:

    "Do everything automatically."

Enterprise security usually means something different.

Automation removes repetitive work.

Humans make difficult decisions.

A good framework knows where automation should stop.

Gen2X models decisions.

Execution engines perform actions.

Keeping those responsibilities separate allows the same framework to
support many different cloud providers.
